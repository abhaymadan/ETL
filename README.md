# ETL

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is a crucial process in data integration and analytics. Azure Synapse, a powerful cloud-based analytics service, offers robust capabilities for ETL workflows. With Synapse, organizations can seamlessly extract data from diverse sources, transform it to meet specific requirements, and load it into target systems.

By leveraging Synapse's scalable and automated data integration features, users can efficiently ingest data from GitHub repositories into their analytical pipelines. Synapse provides built-in connectors for GitHub, enabling users to easily extract and load data. Additionally, Synapse's data transformation capabilities, such as data cleaning, aggregation, and enrichment, empower users to prepare data for analysis.

In conclusion, Azure Synapse simplifies and enhances the ETL process, allowing organizations to efficiently integrate and analyze data from GitHub repositories for data-driven insights.

||  I worked at a data architecture startup to shift data from on-premises servers to a data lake using Azure cloud services. 
||  Used Databricks to transform raw data into structured data and load it into PowerBI to gain insights from the dashboard. 
||  Analyzed processes and debugged issues on the Synapse pipeline, which resulted in the automation of the ETL process with SQL.
||  The ETL incremental load feature was implemented, and the entire data warehousing process was streamlined using Synapse. 
||  Transformed data for analytical or operational purposes is used for financial modeling using PySpark on Azure Databricks. 
||  Built a system for collecting, manipulating, and transforming raw data from an on-premise server to an Azure cloud lake. 
||  Implemented incremental load that performs delta between targets. 
||  Developed ETL automation to reduce incremental load time from 4 hours to 44 minutes, saving 82 percent of the time
